  Here is an account of my reflections through travel, experience, hardship, discomfort, and apprecation.

  where we reduce complexity to binary opposition, <br>
  where we dream but surrender to conformity, <br>
  where we <br>
  where we forego apology for blame, <br>
  here is a taste of the beauty, love, humanity, and compassion. <br>
  In this world we live in, <br>
  where we too often forget to appreciate what we have. <br>
