  Here is an account of my reflections through travel, experience, hardship, discomfort, and apprecation.
    
  <h2> In the world we live in, <h2/>
  <i> where we measure people by their job and not their conscience, <br>
  where we relinquish authenticity for superficiality, <br>
  where we reduce complexity with binary opposition, <br>
  where we dream but surrender to conformity, <br>
  where we <br>
  where we forego apology for blame, <br>
  here is a taste of the beauty, love, humanity, and compassion. <br>
  In this world we live in, <br>
  where we too often forget to appreciate what we have. </i> <br>
  Here are a number of pictures that convey beauty in our world.
  If you look closely, there is more good than bad.
