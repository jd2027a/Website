  <h1> My name is Jean-Sebastien <h1/>
  Here is an account of my reflections through travel, experience, hardship, discomfort, and apprecation.
    
  <h2> In this world we live in, <h2/>
    where we measure people by their job and not their conscience,
    where we relinquish authenticity for superficiality,
    where we reduce complexity to binary opposition, 
    where we dream but surrender to conformity, 
    where we 
    where we forego apology for blame, 
    here is a taste of the beauty, love, humanity, and compassion 
    In this world we live in, 
    where we too often forget to appreciate what we have.
