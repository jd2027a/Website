  Here is an account of my reflections through travel, experience, hardship, discomfort, and apprecation.
    
  <h2> In the world we live in, <h2/>
  <i> where we measure people by their job and not their conscience, <br>
  where we relinquish authenticity for superficiality, <br>
  where we reduce complexity with banality, <br>
  where we suppress morality for honor,
  where we dream but surrender to conformity, <br>
  where we forego apology for blame, <br>
  where we define success as the sum of our belongings and not the sum of our relationships,
  here is a taste of the beauty, love, humanity, and compassion, <br>
  In the world we live in, <br>
  where we too often forget to appreciate family, opportunity, purity </i> <br>
  Here are a number of pictures that reveal some of the beauty in our world. <br>
  Lsook closely, there is more good than bad. <br>
